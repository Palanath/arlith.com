<?php h("Arlith Wiki - Editing a page");?><h1>Wiki Editing</h1>
<p>
	Editing the wiki consists of adding new pages or editing existing
	pages. Each page in the wiki is comprised of a sub-directory of the <code>arlith.net</code>
	folder contained within the wiki's source code repository. The page's
	source code is contained inside an <code>index</code> resource in that
	sub-directory.
